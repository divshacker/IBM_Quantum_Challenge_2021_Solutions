## Solution for Exercise 2
This Exercise seems to be difficult because of the famous [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm).
But the way the exercise teaches how to apply this algorithm, it becomes easy to do.

This have Three Parts and all the parts are required to design a circuit to satisfy the given states required for the praticular question. Once you done this all yo are good to go.

One Way of doing this is just writing out all the given states on paper and applying gates and keep changing the configuration of circuit accordingly  unless it satisfy all the given states.
If you can't find out still then use the answer file to see the answer and check where you went wrong.
